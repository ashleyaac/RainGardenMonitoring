Description of what we desire in the final code:

-- magnetic reed switch will act as a mechanical interrupt (attached to a digital interrupt in Arduino code) to trigger Arduino to
    begin collecting data or to exit sleep mode
-- data will be collected every 10 minutes from all sensors during rain period
-- when rain stops, the sensors will continue to log data every 15 minutes for 2 hours
-- after this two hour period, the arduino will go into sleep mode to save power
      -- maybe use sleepydog library from adafruit to put arduino to sleep? whatever works!
-- the interrupt should be able to be triggered at any point to continue the data logging,
    even within the 2 hour period after the initial rain period.

*times are just initial guesses, we can change these in the code later
