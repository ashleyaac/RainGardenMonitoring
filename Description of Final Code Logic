Description of what we desire in the final code:

-- magnetic reed switch will act as a mechanical interrupt (attached to a digital interrupt in Arduino code) to trigger Arduino to
    begin collecting data or to exit sleep mode
-- data will be sent to gateway every 10 minutes; data from all sensors during rain period
-- when rain stops, the sensors will continue to send data every 15 minutes for 2 hours
-- after this two hour period, the arduino will go into sleep mode to save power
      -- use power-down-sleep command from Arduino library ( https://learn.adafruit.com/low-power-wifi-datalogging/power-down-sleep 
            and http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/ArduinoSleepCode )
-- the interrupt should be able to be triggered at any point to continue the data sending as needed,
    even within the 2 hour period after the initial rain period

*times are just initial guesses, we can change these in the code later
